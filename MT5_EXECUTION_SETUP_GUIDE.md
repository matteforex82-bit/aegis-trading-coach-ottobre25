# 🚀 MT5 Order Execution System - Setup & Testing Guide

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** 28 October 2025
**Status:** Ready for Testing

---

## 📋 Overview

The MT5 Order Execution System enables **bidirectional communication** between the AEGIS Dashboard and MT5 platform:

```
Dashboard → Approve Orders → Database (APPROVED)
     ↓
MT5 EA polls every 10 seconds → Executes on MT5
     ↓
Confirms execution → Database (ACTIVE) → Dashboard updates
```

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **3-Phase Order Lifecycle**

| Phase | Status | Description | Where |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1️⃣ | `PENDING` | User uploads YAML, orders created | Dashboard |
| 2️⃣ | `APPROVED` | User clicks "Execute Selected" | Dashboard |
| 3️⃣ | `ACTIVE` | MT5 EA executes order | MT5 Platform |

### **Communication Flow**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Dashboard: Select & Execute Orders
    Dashboard->>Database: Update status to APPROVED
    MT5 EA->>API: GET /api/trade-orders/pending/{login}
    API->>MT5 EA: Return APPROVED orders
    MT5 EA->>MT5 Platform: Execute OrderSend()
    MT5 Platform->>MT5 EA: Return ticket & price
    MT5 EA->>API: POST /api/trade-orders/confirm-execution
    API->>Database: Update status to ACTIVE
    Database->>Dashboard: Real-time status update
```

     - symbol: EURUSD
       trading_setup:
         direction: BUY
         entry_price: 1.09500
         stop_loss: 1.09000
         take_profit: 1.10000

   📋 Order 1:
      ID: clxxx123
      Symbol: EURUSD
      Direction: BUY
      Lot Size: 0.01

   🚀 Sending order to MT5...
   ✅ Order executed successfully!
      MT5 Ticket: 987654321
      Fill Price: 1.09502
   ✅ Execution confirmed to server
   ```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

### **Dashboard Alerts**

Check Dashboard → Alerts for:
- ✅ "Trade Executed: EURUSD" (INFO)
- ❌ "Trade Execution Failed: EURUSD" (WARNING)

### **MT5 Expert Log**

Key messages to look for:
```
📥 Pending orders response: ...
🎯 Found X pending orders to execute
📋 Order 1: ...
🚀 Sending order to MT5...
✅ Order executed successfully!
✅ Execution confirmed to server
```

### **Server Logs (Vercel)**

Check API logs for:
- `GET /api/trade-orders/pending/{login}` - Should return 200
- `POST /api/trade-orders/confirm-execution` - Should return 200
- Any 401/403 errors indicate API Key issues

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Orders stuck in "APPROVED" (yellow)**

**Possible Causes:**
1. EA not running or crashed
2. EA polling disabled
3. API Key invalid
4. Network/firewall blocking requests

**Solutions:**
- Check MT5 Experts tab for EA status
- Verify API Key is correct
- Check MT5 allowed URLs
- Look for HTTP errors in EA log

### **Problem: EA not finding orders**

**Check:**
1. Account login matches in Dashboard and MT5
2. API Key belongs to correct user
3. Orders have status "APPROVED" (not "PENDING")

**Debug:**
```mql5
// Check EA log for:
"📥 Pending orders response: ..."
// Should show JSON with orderCount > 0
```

### **Problem: Order execution fails**

**Common Errors:**
- Invalid symbol → Check symbol name matches broker
- Invalid volume → Check minimum lot size for broker
- Insufficient margin → Check account balance
- Market closed → Wait for market hours

**MT5 Error Codes:**
- 10004: Requote
- 10006: Request rejected
- 10013: Invalid request
- 10014: Invalid volume
- 10015: Invalid price
- 10016: Invalid stops

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### **API Key Protection**

- ✅ API Keys are hashed with bcrypt in database
- ✅ Keys transmitted via HTTPS only
- ✅ Keys validated on every request
- ✅ lastUsedAt timestamp tracked

### **Order Validation**

- ✅ User ownership verified before execution
- ✅ Account ownership verified
- ✅ Orders cannot be executed twice
- ✅ Failed orders logged with reason

### **MT5 Safety**

- ✅ Magic number 999001 identifies AEGIS trades
- ✅ Stop Loss and Take Profit always set
- ✅ Trade comment includes order ID for tracking
- ✅ EA can be disabled at any time
