- [ ] Verify DrawdownSnapshot created in database
- [ ] Check fields:
  - dailyDrawdownTotal
  - floatingPnL
  - closedPnL

#### Test 9.2: Test Drawdown Limit Warning
**Option:** Manually adjust challenge limits to trigger warning

- [ ] Reduce dailyBudgetDollars to very low value
- [ ] Wait for next drawdown check
- [ ] Verify response includes warnings
- [ ] Check if blockOrders flag set when >90% limit

**Expected Result:**
‚úÖ Drawdown snapshots created every 60 seconds

---

### **Phase 10: Multi-Asset Testing**

- [ ] Generate orders for all 3 assets
- [ ] Verify 3 TradeOrders created (or more if secondary entries)

#### Test 10.2: EA Executes Multiple Orders

- [ ] Each checked independently every 1 second
- [ ] Verify no cross-interference

**Expected Result:**
‚úÖ Multiple orders executed correctly
‚úÖ All positions monitored independently
‚úÖ No conflicts or errors

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES TO TEST FOR

### Critical Bugs to Watch:
- [ ] **Connection Loss**: What happens if API connection drops mid-execution?
- [ ] **Duplicate Orders**: Can EA execute same order twice?
- [ ] **Race Conditions**: Simultaneous order execution and invalidation check?
- [ ] **Price Gaps**: Weekend gap opens beyond invalidation - is position closed Monday?
- [ ] **Account Switch**: What if user changes account in dashboard while EA running?

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] YAML with missing optional fields (e.g., no secondary entry)
- [ ] YAML with invalid invalidation price (e.g., = entry price)
- [ ] Challenge setup without lock enabled
- [ ] Order generation when daily budget exhausted
- [ ] Multiple YAMLs uploaded rapidly
