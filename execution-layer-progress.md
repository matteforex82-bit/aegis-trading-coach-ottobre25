# Execution Layer - Implementation Progress

## Overview
Implementation of the MT5 execution layer with position sizing, risk management, and automated order execution.

---

## Phase 1: Auto-Registration & Data Sync ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Auto-Registration System ✅
- [x] `/api/mt5/connect` endpoint for EA auto-registration
- [x] Automatic API key generation and storage
- [x] EA integration with `AttemptAutoRegistration()` function
- [x] API key display in MT5 logs with copy instructions
- [x] Testing completed successfully

### 1.2 Authentication System ✅
- [x] `verifyMT5ApiKeyDirect()` function for plain text API keys
- [x] Updated all MT5 endpoints to use direct authentication:
  - `/api/mt5/symbols/sync` ✅
  - `/api/mt5/data-sync` ✅
  - `/api/mt5/pending-orders` ✅

### 1.3 Symbol Specifications Sync ✅
- [x] EA collects all broker symbol specifications at startup
- [x] Syncs 863+ symbols with complete specifications
- [x] Database storage in `BrokerSymbolSpec` model
- [x] **Enhanced with swap and currency fields:**
  - `swapLong`, `swapShort`, `swapType` (for overnight cost calculation)
  - `tickValue`, `tickSize` (for precise pip calculations)
  - `currencyBase`, `currencyProfit`, `currencyMargin` (for multi-currency accounts)

### 1.4 Trading Data Sync ✅
- [x] Full history sync on first connection (all historical trades)
- [x] Real-time sync every 60 seconds (positions + recent trades)
- [x] Account metrics tracking (win rate, profit factor, etc.)
- [x] Incremental sync safety checks

### 1.5 Order Polling ✅
- [x] EA polls for pending orders every 10 seconds
- [x] `/api/mt5/pending-orders` endpoint working correctly
- [x] No authentication errors

**Status**: All MT5 ↔ Dashboard communication working perfectly! 🎉

## Phase 2: Position Sizing & Risk Management 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### 2.1 Architecture Decision ✅
**Decision**: Calculate position sizes **on MT5** (Option B)
- Dashboard sends: risk%, symbol, direction, stop loss
- EA calculates optimal size using LIVE broker data
- EA executes and reports back actual size

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Always uses fresh broker data (zero lag)
- ✅ Automatically compliant with broker limits
- ✅ Works with any broker without modifications
- ✅ Native MT5 functions handle all edge cases

### 2.2 Database Schema ✅
- [x] Added swap cost fields to `BrokerSymbolSpec`:
  - `swapLong` - Long position overnight cost
  - `swapShort` - Short position overnight cost
  - `swapType` - Calculation method (POINTS, CURRENCY_BASE, etc.)
- [x] Added currency fields:
  - `currencyBase` - Base currency (e.g., EUR in EURUSD)
  - `currencyProfit` - Profit currency (e.g., USD in EURUSD)
  - `currencyMargin` - Margin currency
- [x] Added tick fields:
  - `tickValue` - Value of one tick in account currency
  - `tickSize` - Minimum price movement

### 2.3 EA Symbol Sync Enhancement ✅
- [x] EA reads swap costs from broker: `SYMBOL_SWAP_LONG`, `SYMBOL_SWAP_SHORT`, `SYMBOL_SWAP_MODE`
- [x] EA reads tick information: `SYMBOL_TRADE_TICK_VALUE`, `SYMBOL_TRADE_TICK_SIZE`
- [x] EA reads currency info: `SYMBOL_CURRENCY_BASE`, `SYMBOL_CURRENCY_PROFIT`, `SYMBOL_CURRENCY_MARGIN`
- [x] EA maps swap mode to string types (POINTS, CURRENCY_BASE, PERCENT_OPEN, etc.)
- [x] All data sent to server via enhanced JSON payload

### 2.4 Position Sizing Function (EA) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement `CalculatePositionSize()` function in EA
- [x] Inputs:
  - `symbol` - Trading pair
  - `direction` - BUY or SELL
  - `stopLoss` - Stop loss price
  - `riskPercent` - Risk percentage (e.g., 1.0 for 1%)
  - `entryPrice` - Entry price (optional, use market if null)
- [x] Logic:
  ```cpp
  // 1. Get LIVE account data
  balance = AccountInfoDouble(ACCOUNT_BALANCE)

  // 2. Calculate risk amount
  riskMoney = balance * (riskPercent / 100.0)

  // 3. Calculate stop loss distance in ticks
  tickSize = SymbolInfoDouble(symbol, SYMBOL_TRADE_TICK_SIZE)
  stopLossTicks = ABS(entryPrice - stopLoss) / tickSize

  // 4. Get tick value
  tickValue = SymbolInfoDouble(symbol, SYMBOL_TRADE_TICK_VALUE)

  // 5. Calculate raw volume
  volume = riskMoney / (stopLossTicks * tickValue)

  // 6. Normalize to broker constraints
  minVol = SymbolInfoDouble(symbol, SYMBOL_VOLUME_MIN)
  maxVol = SymbolInfoDouble(symbol, SYMBOL_VOLUME_MAX)
  stepVol = SymbolInfoDouble(symbol, SYMBOL_VOLUME_STEP)
  volume = NormalizeVolume(volume, minVol, maxVol, stepVol)
  ```
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and validation
- [x] Detailed logging for debugging
- [x] Returns actual risk amount and percent after normalization
- [ ] Test on: Forex (EURUSD), Indices (SP500), Commodities (XAUUSD), Crypto (BTCUSD)

### 2.5 Swap Cost Calculator ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement `CalculateSwapCost()` function
- [x] Calculate 5-day and 10-day holding costs
- [x] Use `swapLong`/`swapShort` and `swapType` from symbol specs
- [x] Support all swap modes:
  - SYMBOL_SWAP_MODE_POINTS
  - SYMBOL_SWAP_MODE_CURRENCY_SYMBOL/MARGIN/DEPOSIT
  - SYMBOL_SWAP_MODE_INTEREST_CURRENT
  - SYMBOL_SWAP_MODE_INTEREST_OPEN
- [x] Return cost in account currency
- [ ] Display in dashboard order preview (pending integration)

### 2.6 TradeOrder Model Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] `riskPercent` field already exists (what dashboard sends)
- [x] Added `calculatedVolume` field (what EA calculated)
- [x] Added `actualRisk` field (actual $ risk with calculated volume)
- [x] Added `actualRiskPercent` field (actual % after normalization)
- [x] Added `swapCost5Day` and `swapCost10Day` fields
- [x] Schema pushed to production database

## Phase 3: Order Execution Flow 🔲 TODO

### 3.1 Dashboard → EA Order Flow
- [ ] User creates setup on dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard sends order with:
  ```json
  {
    "symbol": "EURUSD",
    "direction": "BUY",
    "orderType": "BUY_LIMIT",
    "entryPrice": 1.0900,
    "stopLoss": 1.0850,
    "takeProfit1": 1.0950,
    "riskPercent": 1.0
  }
  ```
- [ ] Order stored in `TradeOrder` table with status `PENDING`

### 3.2 EA Polling & Execution
- [ ] EA polls `/api/mt5/pending-orders` every 10 seconds
- [ ] For each pending order:
  - [ ] Calculate optimal volume using `CalculatePositionSize()`
  - [ ] Calculate swap costs for user preview
  - [ ] Execute order on broker
  - [ ] Report back: actual ticket, volume, risk, costs
- [ ] Update order status to `EXECUTED` with MT5 ticket reference

### 3.3 Execution Feedback
- [ ] EA sends execution result:
  ```json
  {
    "orderId": "abc123",
    "mt5Ticket": 12345678,
    "calculatedVolume": 0.15,
    "actualRisk": 980.50,
    "actualRiskPercent": 0.98,
    "swapCost5Day": 2.50,
    "swapCost10Day": 5.00,
    "executionPrice": 1.09001,
    "executedAt": "2025-11-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Dashboard updates UI with actual execution details

---

## Phase 4: Monitors & Safety Features 🔲 TODO

### 4.1 Invalidation Monitor
- [ ] Already implemented in EA (checks every 1 second)
- [ ] Connect to dashboard-defined invalidation prices
- [ ] Auto-close position if price hits invalidation level
- [ ] Send alert to dashboard

### 4.2 Drawdown Monitor
- [ ] Already checking every 60 seconds
- [ ] Enhanced to use challenge limits from `ChallengeSetup`
- [ ] Send snapshots to `/api/mt5/drawdown-snapshot` endpoint
- [ ] Alert if approaching daily/total loss limits

### 4.3 Order Lock Feature
- [ ] Prevent modification of orders after placement
- [ ] Prevent closing positions manually (only via invalidation or TP/SL)
- [ ] Configurable in `ChallengeSetup.orderLockEnabled`
